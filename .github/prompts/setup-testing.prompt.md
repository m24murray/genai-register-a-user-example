"I am building a Node.js web application and want to set up unit testing using Jest. Please help me configure the testing environment with the following requirements:

Configuration:

Create a jest.config.ts file to configure Jest for the project.
Ensure TypeScript support by integrating ts-jest.
Include a test script in package.json to run the tests.
Configure Jest to look for test files in a tests directory and match files with .test.ts or .spec.ts extensions.
Set up code coverage reporting.
Dependencies:

Install all necessary dependencies, including Jest, ts-jest, and @types/jest.
Example Test:

Create an example test file, e.g., tests/example.test.ts.
Write a simple test case to verify that Jest is working correctly. For example, test a function that adds two numbers.
Best Practices:

Ensure the test environment is isolated and does not affect the main application.
Use mocking where necessary to simulate external dependencies.
Documentation:

Update the README.md file to include instructions on how to run the tests and interpret the results.
Linting:

Ensure the test files follow the same linting rules as the rest of the project.
