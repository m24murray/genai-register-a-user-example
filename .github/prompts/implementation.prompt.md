# Implementation prompt
This project has a file called `spec.md` that includes a detailed specification for a node app that I want to build. 

I want you to break it down into small, iterative pieces that you can implement. This should be output to a file called `implementation-plan.md` 

Each iteration should list a set of detailed prompts of what should be done to help facilitate the implementation. Each iteration must fit in with what has come before it and there should be no orphaned code. 

Each iteration should contain a section for the following information that will be updated later:
* Current status (Not started, In progress, Complete)
* Lines of code added
* Number of unit tests added
* Cost to implement
  * In/out tokens consumed
  * Approx. cost in dollars
  * API time (time spent processing)
  * Wall time (real world time to implement this iteration)

Each iteration should also contain a checklist for the following items:
- Development complete
- Files linted
- Unit tests passing
- Implementation plan updated
- Readme updated
