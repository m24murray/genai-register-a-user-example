# Next steps

Using GenAI try and expand upon this app, adding the following functionality

There is no right or wrong way to do these things, what's important is that you get hands on experience with GenAI tools.

* Add a new employment history page that fits in between the address and the summary pages.
* Try and persist the name, address and employment information and display on the summary page.
* Update the styling, e.g. add a nice header, adjust the column width.
* Try and integrate an API endpoint, for example, pull bank holiday information and display this on a page. 
    * Add more functionality to show the next avaliable bank holiday or to filter bank holidays to only show those of the country that the user is based in (based upon their post code on the address section).
* Persist submissions in an in memory database, have a page that lists all submitted applications.
